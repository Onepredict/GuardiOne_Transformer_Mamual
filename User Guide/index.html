### Rule - Basic Gas Ratios
Basic Gas ratios is an evaluation of possible fault type method provided in ‘IEC 60599 – Mineral oil-filed electrical equipment in service – Guidance on the interpretation of dissolved and free gases analysis’ for diagnosis of fault mode. The method is active when the transformer is detected worse than caution status by means of AI techniques.

-   R1 (Ratio1, C2H2/C2H4), R2 (Ratio2, CH4/H2), R5 (Ratio5, C2H4/C2H6) are compared to limiting values, suggests corresponding fault mode. The small square boxes next to 3D plot represents the fault mode provided by Basic Gas Ratios. The value points location shows the specific fault condition. 
-   Users click on the specific fault mode square box in the legend and put the cursor on the corresponding fault mode point in 3D plot, the measurement date, fault mode, three gas values are indicated by a pop-up window. 
-   Measurement date, fault mode and gas composition ratios in table form are provided so that users conveniently check the fault mode history. 
-   If the denominator gas value of the any of four gas composition ratios is 0, the status is displayed as 'No diagnosis possible'. In addition, if the fault mode cannot be calculated from the method, the result is output as ‘Fault not identifiable’.
-   A function of pop-up window is provided to enlarge the plot.

### Similarity Trend Analysis (Optional) 
This function provides users with meaningful insights for predictive maintenance of transformers by presenting the most similar transformers status analysis.
*&nbsp;Exception: Similarity analysis is inactivated if data is not enough.


**(1)   DGA Similarity Chart:** This chart shows the similarity of the top three most similar transformers. Click each transformer, the Analysis Table, DGA Trend, Health Status Trend are displayed. 


<p align="center"><img src="./img/Similarity_1.PNG" height="220px" width="100px">


**(2)   Analysis Table:** This table provides all status information of the similar transformer.
-   Including initial measurement date, similar time interval of targeted transformer, final measurement date, health status of final measurement date. 
-   If the status of final data is diagnosed worse than caution, the fault modes analyzed by Duval Triangle 1, Doernenburg Ratios, Rogers Ratios, Basic Gas Ratios are offered. 
-   If the fault is detected, the fault component is also indicated in the table. 
-   The final status and date can give the insight to user that the target transformer can have the similar status after the similar section.


<p align="center"><img src="./img/Similarity_2.PNG" height="120px" width="600px">


**(3)   DGA Trend:** This plot provides the main DGA gas concentration trends of similar transformer from initial to final.
-   The plotted gases are main six gases (H2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, CO). 
-   The highlighted white translucent background section is the most similar section.
-   The users can on/off a gas trend by clicking the legend of the gas. 
-   Putting the cursor on a data point, the values of all selected gases are indicated by a pop-up window.
-   A function of pop-up window is provided to enlarge the plot. 


<p align="center"><img src="./img/Similarity_3.PNG" height="140px" width="600px">


**(4)   Health Status Trend:** This plot provides whole health status trend of similar transformer.
-   The highlighted white translucent background section is the most similar section. 
-   Putting the cursor on a data point, the measurement date is indicated by a pop-up window.
-   A function of pop-up window is provided to enlarge the plot.
※ Blue : (Normal status) / Green: (Caution status) / Yellow : (Warning status) / Orange : (Critical status) / Red: (Fault status).

<h3 id="industrial-ai-based-diagnosis-and-prognosis">Industrial AI-based Diagnosis and Prognosis</h3>
<p>This function provides overall diagnostic and prognostic results based on industrial AI methods. The dashboard contains health feature space, health state trend, the health status at present and future, and fault isolation.   </p>
<p><strong>(1)   Health Feature Space:</strong> Health feature space is composed of two key health features derived from deep learning.  This space is a diagnostic space which shows the entire health feature trend over time. 
-   The big points on the background data are health features of targeted transformer and the highlighted point is the latest feature calculated with the latest DGA data.
-   User can check the movement of the health feature by adjusting the color bar in the upper right.
-   User can zoom in and out the feature space by adjusting right vertical white bar and lower horizontal white bar or using mouse wheel button. And, click the ‘int’ button, the feature space returns to the original size.
-   User can activate or deactivate the health feature by clicking the item in the legend.
-   Putting the cursor on a data point, the measurement date and gas values are indicated by a pop-up window. 
-   Users can trace the movement of feature points to check the condition of the transformers. If featured points are colored in orange or close to the red section, it is recommended to check the value change carefully for transformer protection. Even if the movement of the dots are slight, it may cause a huge damage to the transformer only with a small abnormal operation. <br />
※ Blue : (Normal status) / Green: (Caution status) / Yellow : (Warning status) / Orange : (Critical status) / Red: (Fault status</p>
